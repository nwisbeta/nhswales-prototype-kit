## About the NHS.Wales prototype kit

The NHS.Wales prototype kit enables you to make interactive prototypes that will look like pages on NHS.Wales. The prototypes you make are a great way to show ideas to others and for conducting user research.

## Security

If you publish your prototypes online, they must be protected by a <a href="http://nhswales-prototype-kit.azurewebsites.net/docs/how-tos/heroku">username and password</a>. This is to prevent members of the public finding prototypes and thinking they are real services.

You must protect user privacy at all times, even when using prototypes. Prototypes made with the kit look like NHS.Wales, but do not have the same security provisions. Always make sure you are handling user data appropriately.
