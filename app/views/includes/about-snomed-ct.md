## About SNOMED CT

### Overview

As the designated clinical terminology for NHS Wales, the Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine - Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT) is one of the most comprehensive clinical terminologies available.

It improves the way that clinical information is recorded for better data management and analysis. This supports patient care, and enables data extraction and exchange.

### Why SNOMED CT?

SNOMED CT supports the health and social care system in Wales to make better use of clinical data to improve:

*   individual, direct patient care
*   disease management
*   research
*   service delivery
*   policy development

The clinical terminology is rigorously controlled, which offers improved opportunities for real-time decision making and accurate reporting. Its vocabulary is precise, clinically validated, and can be updated in real time to capture emerging health issues.

SNOMED CT is playing an important role in safeguarding clinical information, making sure that data is shared efficiently between systems and clinicians. Clinical information can be recorded in a way that supports data management and analysis to support patient care, while enabling data extraction and data exchange.

SNOMED CT will also play a central role in opening up NHS Walesâ€™ healthcare information for reporting outcomes. This isn't possible using existing terminologies and classifications.
