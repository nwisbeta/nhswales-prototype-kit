      <h2>Overview</h2>

      <p>Improving communication between systems is a key part of the <a href="https://gov.wales/healthier-wales-long-term-plan-health-and-social-care" target="_blank">Welsh Government's A Healthier Wales strategy (opens in a new tab)</a>. To improve patient outcomes, systems need to speak and understand a shared language so that care is more joined-up.</p>
      <P>The terminology service FHIR API does just that, enabling users to develop applications that interact with health record content using a set of national standards.  </p>
      <h4>What a terminology service is</h4>
      <p>The way that electronic healthcare records are written and stored can differ between care settings. This makes it difficult to share content quickly and accurately from one clinical system to another.</p>
      <p>A terminology service gives structure to healthcare record content. It assigns unique codes to information like symptoms, medications and procedures to form a consistent clinical terminology that can be processed by any system. For example, one clinician might record a diagnosis as 'influenza', and another might record it as 'flu'. A terminology service translates those synonyms into one code that can be understood by both computers and clinicians.</p>
      <p>At NHS Wales, we use the SNOMED CT clinical terminology.</p>


        <h3>About SNOMED CT</h3>
        <p>Used by healthcare services worldwide, SNOMED CT is one of the most comprehensive clinical terminologies available. Its vocabulary is precise, clinically validated, and can be updated in real time to capture emerging health issues.</p>
        <p>SNOMED CT content is rigorously controlled, which offers improved opportunities for real-time decision making and accurate reporting. Read more about <a href="https://www.snomed.org/snomed-ct/why-snomed-ct" target="_blank">the benefits of using SNOMED CT (opens in a new tab)</a>. </p>
        <p>This edition of SNOMED CT contains extensions specific to the UK, including clinical terms, screening procedures and British English spellings.</p>


      <h3>About FHIR APIs</h3>

      <p>Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) is a standard for quickly and accurately transferring healthcare data between systems. FHIR features components called resources that can be used to define terminologies, as well as clear specifications for presenting terminologies.</p>
      <p>Working to this standard framework means that data can be shared more consistently wherever patient care is taking place. Read <a href="https://digitalhealth.wales/news/fhir-interoperability-wales" target="_blank">how NHS Wales is working with FHIR APIs (opens in a new tab)</a>.</p>
      <p>FHIR is free to use, and designed to be easy to understand and implement. You can find detailed <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/summary.html" target="_blank"> information about FHIR specifications (opens in a new tab)</a> on the HL7 website.</p>
