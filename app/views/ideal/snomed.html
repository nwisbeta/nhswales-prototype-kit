      <h2>About SNOMED CT</h2>
      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>As the designated clinical terminology for NHS Wales, the Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine - Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT) is one of the most comprehensive clinical terminologies available.</p>
      <p>It improves the way that clinical information is recorded for better data management and analysis. This supports patient care, and enables data extraction and exchange.</p>
      <h3>Why SNOMED CT?</h3>
      <p>SNOMED CT supports the health and social care system in Wales to make better use of clinical data to improve:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>individual, direct patient care</li>
        <li>disease management</li>
        <li>research</li>
        <li>service delivery</li>
        <li>policy development</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The clinical terminology is rigorously controlled, which offers improved opportunities for real-time decision making and accurate reporting. Its vocabulary is precise, clinically validated, and can be updated in real time to capture emerging health issues.</p>
        <p>SNOMED CT is playing an important role in safeguarding clinical information, making sure that data is shared efficiently between systems and clinicians. Clinical information can be recorded in a way that supports data management and analysis to support patient care, while enabling data extraction and data exchange.  </p>
          <p>SNOMED CT will also play a central role in opening up NHS Walesâ€™ healthcare information for reporting outcomes. This isn't possible using existing terminologies and classifications.  </p>
